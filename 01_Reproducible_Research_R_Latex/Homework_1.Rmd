For each assignment, turn in by the due date/time.  Late assignments must be  arranged prior to submission.  In every case, assignments are to be typed neatly using proper English in Markdown.

This week, we spoke about Reproducible Research, R, Rstudio, Rmarkdown, and LaTeX.  To summarize the ideas behind Reproducible Research, we are focusing on Reproducible Analysis.  For us, Reproducible Analysis is accomplished by mixing code, figures and text into a cohesive document that fully describes both the process we took to go from data to results and the rational behind our data driven conclusions.  Our goal should be to enable a moderately informed reader to follow our document and reproduce the steps we took to reach the results and hopefully conclusions we obtained.

## Problem 1

Set up your computing platform.  For this class, we will be using Git, R, and Python as the main software choices.  If you install or get accounts as shown in the following table in the order listed, you should end with a usable install of all softwares used in the class.

Package         Source
-------         --------------------------------
Git:            https://git-scm.com/
Github:         https://github.com (account) 
Latex           https://miktex.org/
R:              https://cran.r-project.org/  
Rstuido:        https://rstudio.com/  
Python:         https://www.python.org/ 
ARC account:    arc.vt.edu (user requests, account request)
Command line:   native Terminal (Mac)
                Putty (or equivelant WinSCP, etc; Windows)
                https://secure.hosting.vt.edu/www.arc.vt.edu/accessing-unix-system/#sshClients
-------         --------------------------------

## Problem 2

R is an open source, community built, programming platform.  Not only is there a plethra of useful web based resources, there also exist in-R tutorials.  To speed our learning, we will use one such tutorial _swirl_.  Please install the _swirl_ package, install the "R_Programming_E" lesson set, and complete at least one of the following lessons 1-4, 8, 5 or 6.  Each lesson takes about 10 min.  

From the R command prompt:  
install.packages("swirl")  
library(swirl)  
install_course("R_Programming_E")  
swirl()  


## Problem 3

Now that we have the R environment setup and have a basic understanding of R, let's add Markdown (choose File, New File, R Markdown, pdf).  
a. In this new Rmarkdown file, please type a paragraph about what you are hoping to get out of this class.  Include at least 3 specific desired learning objectives in list format.  
b. To this, add 3 density functions (Appendix Cassella & Berger) in centered format with equation number, i.e. format this as you would find in a journal.  

## Problem 4

A quote from Donoho (1995): "an article about computational results is advertising, not scholarship. The actual scholarship is the full software environment, code and data, that produced the result."  To the document created in Problem 3, add a summary of the steps in performing Reproducible Research in numbered list format as detailed in:  
<http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003285>.  
\newline
Next to each item, comment on any challenges you see in performing the step.  If you are interested in learning more, a good summary of why this is important can be found in  
- <https://www.informs.org/ORMS-Today/Public-Articles/October-Volume-38-Number-5/Reproducible-Operations-Research>  
- <https://doi.org/10.1093/biostatistics/kxq028>  
- <http://statweb.stanford.edu/~wavelab/Wavelab_850/wavelab.pdf>

## Problem 5

We will be using GitHub in all future assignments.  To prepare for this, get a GitHub account.  Please include a link to your github page AND please email me your username.  


**This document containing solutions to Problems 3-5 should be typed in RMarkdown and Knit'd to create a pdf document turned in at the beginning of the next class.**


## Optional preperation for next class:  
We will be using Git for future assignments, if you have time, please follow the git tutorial at:
