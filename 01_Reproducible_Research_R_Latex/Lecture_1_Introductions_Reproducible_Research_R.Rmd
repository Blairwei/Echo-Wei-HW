## Passing the course  

Q. How do you pass the course??  
A. Do the homework AND participate.

There will be ca. 14 homeworks, you need to pass 10.  Each homework will be given 10 points, 7 is passing.  Point breakdown  will be:

- 2 pts for submitting  
- 2 pts for clean, well written document  
- 2 pts for complete description of analysis process  
- 4 pts for completing the assigned tasks.  

Participation will be defined in the next class and is all or nothing.

## Reproducible Research | Setting the stage

You have worked 6 months to analyze a data set.  You give your collaborator the perfect analysis and the results are very exciting.  They go away very happy and you don't hear from them for 1 year.  Suddenly, a flurry of emails ensues, they have new data to add to the previous pipeline, they need alterations to your perfect figure, they have lots of how did you questions, they ask you to write a methods section, etc etc.  You publish your perfect results.  Someone else analyzes the data and comes to *different* conclusions.  Are you sure you didn't have a bug in your code?  How good are your notes???

## Reproducible Research | Concepts

Guide to this topic here:  
<http://ropensci.github.io/reproducibility-guide/>

The general, we should **weave** code and text into a complete reference of our work.  The code should:

- download (or otherwise load) data
- reproduce steps to munge data
- recreate analysis steps
- create figures and tables
- explain any and all steps along the way
- end with conclusions drawn
- optionally add suggestions for future experiments

```

## R and Rstudio

From <http://r-project.org>  
R is an integrated suite of software facilities for data manipulation, calculation and graphical display. 

Rstudio is an IDE for R.  <http://rstudio.com>

Reasons to use R:  

* free  
* open source  
* large community of both users and developers  
* large number of extensions to facilitate common tasks (packages)  
* superb functionality for data processing
* very mature statistical and graphical capabilities

## R packages
R packages are community written (and often tested) extensions to R to enhance the functionality of R.  

Examples:  

1. MASS  
    + mvrnorm  
    + stepAIC  
2. ggplot2  
    + grammer of graphics  
3. knitr  
    + RMarkdown  

## Rmarkdown  

RMarkdown:  "Analyze. Share. Reproduce."

Seems like what we are looking for.  

A Markdown-formatted document should be publishable as-is, as plain text, without looking like itâ€™s been marked up with tags or formatting instructions.
__John Gruber__

Rstudio includes an "extended and slightly revised version" of Gruber's original Markdown syntax. This includes codes for many common text writing scenarios:

1. adding lists  
    + numbered, bullets, etc  
2. text formatting  
    + bold, italics, highlight, etc  
3. adding equations  
    + full $\LaTeX$ styled equations  
    + numbering, indenting, aligning, etc  


## $\LaTeX$  

<http://latex-project.org>  
$\LaTeX$ is a high-quality typesetting system; it includes features designed for the production of technical and scientific documentation. $\LaTeX$ is the de facto standard for the communication and publication of scientific documents. $\LaTeX$ is available as free software.

Which includes many many math symbols:  
<http://web.ift.uib.no/Teori/KURS/WRK/TeX/symALL.html>

And has a cool online tool:

## Reproducible Research | Coding

Combining $\LaTeX$ and Knitr, we have a system to weave text and code into a highly customizable and formatted analysis report.
