### Grading:  
Grading based on weekly homework.

### Grading details:  

Homework will be assigned each week and is accessible via the course git repository. Feel free to discuss assignments with other students, but the work handed in must be exclusively your own unless otherwise noted. Each assignment must be neatly typed in Rmarkdown in formal, correct English. Note that after the first assignement, ALL assignments will be accessible and searchable on the web. As such, think of these assignments as your first public work.  Assignments' due date is one week after the assigned date.

### Course details

This course endeavors to build competence in R and Python programming.  We will use Swirl and lintr to reinforce the programming concepts. As we explore programming methods, we will use Rmarkdown for document typesetting. In the process of working through this course, you will gain familiarity with version control and \LaTeX via markdown. The course will include, but is not restricted to, the following programming topics:
\begin{itemize}
\item R, Rmarkdown, Rprojects, Rnotebooks
\item Git as a code repository
\item Functions, conditional statements and loops in R
\item Base graphics in R
\item Apply family of functions in R
\item Matrix and vector math in R
\item Bash/sed/awk
\item Python  
\item Parallel computing
\item Shiny
\item Scaling out compute
\end{itemize}

\noindent In the process of learning the above programming methods, we will also explore the following statistical methods:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Exploratory Data Analysis tools
    \item Linear regression
    \item ANOVA
    \item Monte Carlo procedures
    \item Power
\end{itemize}

### Honor System  

Students enrolled in this course are responsible for abiding by the Honor Code. A student who has doubts about how the Honor Code applies to any assignment is responsible for obtaining specific guidance from the course instructor before submitting the assignment for evaluation. Ignorance of the rules does not exclude any member of the University community from the requirements and expectations of the Honor Code.  

\noindent The Virginia Tech honor pledge for assignments is as follows: __*"I have neither given nor received unauthorized assistance on this assignment."*__

\noindent The pledge is to be written out on all graded assignments at the university and signed by the student. The honor pledge represents both an expression of the studentâ€™s support of the honor code and an unambiguous acknowledgment that the student has, on the assignment in question, abided by the obligation that the Honor Code entails. In the absence of a written honor pledge, the Honor Code still applies to an assignment.  For additional information about the Honor Code, please visit:
